This script allows for querying AWS to find the right resources when you need them.


INSTALL
=======
Installing those scripts is a pip command away!
Sadly, Bitbucket SSL is somehow troubling to BitBucket...
Anyway, this command will do the trick:

sudo pip install https://github.com/azafred/loony/archive/master.zip
(don't use sudo if you are in a virtualenv, but the script will then only be available when in that virtualenv...)

One could also clone the repo and run

git clone ssh://git@bitbucket.sparkcentral.ninja:7999/int/loony.git
cd loony
python setup.py install
